# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on react native project. 1st day of learning Redux.

**Thoughts:** 
I really feel confusing. Do not know where I am going but stay focused on my objectives. Maybe It does not count for this 100 days of code challenge but I began yesterday and I would not want to stop it now.
